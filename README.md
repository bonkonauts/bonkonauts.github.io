### **_Calculators_**
Bonkonauts features a few calculators at the moment:
  1. DBID2DATE 
     * This allows you to easily convert a bonk DBID to a date, helping you figure out roughly when the account was created!
     * If you are currently logged in, the value will default to your DBID.
  2. XP/Level Calculator
     * This allows you to convert a level value into XP, and an XP value into level directly.
  3. Goal Calculator
     * This allows you to see how far your account is from a certain goal.
     * You are allowed to type in either the level or XP boxes, depending on how specific you feel!
     * If you are currently logged in, the value will default to your DBID.

### **_Leaderboard_**
  - The leaderboard is basically a list of every user that has logged in to **bonkonauts**, and is used more like a level leaderboard. It displays the highest level users at the top, and lowest level at the bottom. Anytime you login to **bonkonauts** or press the `Reload` button, the leaderboard will update accordingly.
  - As of right now, the leaderboard is currently deprecated due to lack of a server...
  - This screenshot is currently from an old build of **bonkonauts**.
